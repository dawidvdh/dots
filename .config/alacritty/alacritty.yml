# Sample Font configuration for font: Monoid.

font:
  # Normal font face - Also used to draw glyphs on tmux & VIM
  # NOTE: You may use any font you'd like but make sure the normal fonts
  # support ligatures/glyphs. That's used by tmux & VIM to provide a better
  # UI for powerline & tmux bottom bar.

    # Font name
    family: Source Code Pro for Powerline
    # Font face

  # Italic font face

  # Bold italic font face
  # Note: Since i don't have a font italic version of this font, I just specified
  # italic & it just works. You may specifiy the bold italic version if it exists
  # for your font

  # Font size

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing
  # I've given in 14 spacing which fits really well with my fonts, you may change it
  # to your convenience but make sure to adjust 'glyph_offset' appropriately post that
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 14

  # Note: This requires RESTART
  # By default when you change the offset above you'll see an issue, where the texts are bottom
  # aligned with the cursor, this is to make sure they center align.
  # This offset should usually be 1/2 of the above offset-y being set.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    # Keeping this as half of offset to vertically align the text in cursor
